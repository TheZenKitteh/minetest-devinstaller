This project is to help make getting and compiling
the development versions of Minetest easier.

There is a cli version (no GUI) and a GUI version
for Ubuntu based distros.

There may be in the future an installer for Windows
but for now there isn't.


How to use cli installer:
* Download the ubuntu/getminetestdev-cli.sh
* Open a terminal and cd to where it is located
* chmod u+x getminetestdev-cli.sh
* ./getminetestdev-cli.sh


How to use the GUI installer:
* wait till it is made
* check this readme file then


How to use the Windows installer:
* wait till it is made
* check this readme file then
